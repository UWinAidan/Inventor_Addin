## Session handoff (ContextKeeper)

- Updated: 2026-10-24. Branch `claude/m4-hole-generator`; PR #29 open against `main`.
- Goal: the next M4 part 1 round, planned and waiting. Aidan's six changes after his first look at PR #29 are logged in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-10-24), written into spec 09 (and spec 04 question 1), and planned as tasks 103 (widened to every command), 105 and 107 to 119 in `docs/PLAN.md`.
- Current state: nothing from 091 to 106 has run in Inventor. **Do not run the round yet**: Aidan sends his PR #29 checklist results first, so it all runs as one round.
- Next steps:
  1. When Aidan's checklist results arrive: turn each failure into a fix task (numbered from 120), add it to the round's order in `docs/PLAN.md`, update `TODO.md`.
  2. Run the round per `docs/WORKFLOW.md`: in-place editing first (spike 103 with Aidan, then 105 and 109), spikes 107 and 108 with Aidan, then 111, 112, 113, 119, the fixes, 110, 117, 114, 115, 116, 118.
  3. Complete tasks 105, 109, 110, 114 and 115 from their spikes' Recommendations before running them.
- Gotchas: `cat > file` with no heredoc in Git Bash waits on stdin and hangs; write scripts with the Write tool into the scratchpad. Many tracked files are CRLF: replace with line-ending-aware scripts. `GetValueFromExpression` throws "Unspecified error" with no reason; abort a nested transaction before its parent. Spike 081's code is at commit `1ef94fa` (branch deleted).
- Read first: `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/PLAN.md` (M4 part 1, "Round after PR #29's first look"), spec `docs/features/09-awb-hole.md`, task files 103 and 107 to 119.

## Big items

| Item | Spec | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundations (M0) | 01 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Settings, log, ribbon, error reporting, Settings and About windows, editing-command base, "AWB Addin" branding |
| Part properties window (M1) | 07 | **Built and merged, partly tested in Inventor** | Opens on parts and assemblies, pre-fills, writes and undoes correctly. A never-saved part shows New part, Not saved yet and Not assigned; the blank Part type entry can be clicked. Some checklist steps not yet reported; see `TODO.md` |
| Window style and icons (M1b) | 08 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Tasks 020 to 031. Shared look in light and dark, all three windows restyled, icons on ribbon and headers, XAML rules test. Every check passed on Windows. Two follow-ups on the build's deploy line are in `TODO.md` |
| Part creation and numbering (M2) | 02 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Every check passed; the last run 1 checks were reported on 2026-10-17. Run 2 checked on Windows 2026-10-11; fix run 053 to 061 and fix run 2 (spike 062, tasks 063 to 066) checked 2026-10-12 and passed. Merged into main from `claude/m2-fix-run` |
| Material and finish (M3) | 03 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Tasks 067 to 080, merged into main from `claude/m3-material-finish` on 2026-10-17: starter library and finish list, Material and Finish window and button, Part Properties Change button and warning, Settings and About on every ribbon, windows that fit the screen, Settings as one resizable page of collapsible sections, dialogs with only a close button, and a themed scroll bar. Every check passed |
| AWB Hole (M4 part 1) | 09 | **Built, waiting for Aidan's check in Inventor** | Decided by Aidan 2026-10-17; spike 081 done with Aidan. Tasks 082 to 090 checked by Aidan 2026-10-18 (making, picking, previewing, tapped and dowel holes, OK, Cancel and Undo work). Then built on branch `claude/m4-hole-generator`, compiled on Windows, not yet run in Inventor: fixes and requests 093 to 101, mockup 102 (approved with changes 2026-10-23), dowel seats 106, window redesign 104, takeover of Hole and H 091, Edit Feature and double-click 092. Aidan's first look on 2026-10-24 gave six changes, planned as tasks 103 (in place for every command, top priority), 105 and 107 to 119: client graphics preview, Simple and Taper Tapped types, Spotface, toleranced clearance holes, depths below the seat, centres per point, a window that fits at 150 percent. They run in one round with the fixes from his checklist results |
| Hole table wizard (M4 part 2) | 04 | Not started | Planned after AWB Hole. Core half needs three answers; add-in half needs a Windows spike |
| Drawing tools (M5) | 05 | Not started | Waiting on which commands Aidan wants. Will include a custom drawing template |
| iLogic injection (M6) | 06 | Not started | Waiting on which rules |
| Distribution (installer, download page) | none yet | Parked | Was to be decided when M2 was planned; still waiting on Aidan |

States used: Not started, Planned, In progress, Built (merged, not tested in Inventor), Partly tested, Done (tested in Inventor), Parked, Proposed.

## What works in Inventor today

- An **AWB Addin** tab on the part, assembly and drawing ribbons, and with no document open; Settings and About are on it everywhere.
- **Part Properties** (parts and assemblies): shows part number, part name, part type, designer, detailer, cost, material, finish and weight. Part type, designer, detailer and cost can be edited. One Undo reverts an Apply.
- **One shared window look** in Inventor's light and dark themes, with keyboard navigation, and icons on the ribbon buttons and window headers.
- **Settings**: show developer tools, default designer. One scrolling page of collapsible sections, resizable by its edges and remembered (tasks 079, 080).
- **About**: version, build time, Inventor version, log folder.
- **Developer panel** (off by default): export the active document or the asset libraries to JSON.
- **Build deploy line**: a Windows build copies the add-in into Inventor and says whether it did. The `Deployed` line shows only with `-tl:off`; see `TODO.md`.

## Numbers

- Tasks finished: 90 (001 to 090), plus 091 to 102, 104 and 106 on branch `claude/m4-hole-generator`
- Core tests: 2650 after task 080; they run in the cloud and on Windows with `dotnet test tests/InventorAddin.Core.Tests`
