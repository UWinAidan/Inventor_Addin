## Session handoff (ContextKeeper)

- Updated: 2026-10-25. Branch `claude/m4-hole-generator`; PR #29 open against `main`. The spike branch `spike/103-in-place-edit` (`313e7cf`, `2e4e650`) is local only and never merged.
- Spike 103 done (rounds 1 and 2 with Aidan): Results and Recommendations in `docs/tasks/103-spike-in-place-edit.md`. Tasks 105 and 109 written in full; new tasks 133 (mini toolbar Hole button `PartDMHoleCmd`) and 134 (Save As and Replace renames the occurrence it replaces, from Aidan's Rename report: Inventor's `Replace` keeps the occurrence name, so later Renames found no match).
- Spike log gap: only AWB Hole, Material and Finish, Part Properties and About were seen run in place; the other commands and the sub-assembly case are on task 109's checklist.
- `libraries/AWB_Holes.xlsx` change was Aidan's (097-5 test) and was discarded.
- Next: run 105, 109, 133, 134 per `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (implementer, reviewer, commit each), then spikes 107 and 108 with Aidan, then the order in `docs/PLAN.md`.
- Gotchas: build with `dotnet build InventorAddin.slnx -tl:off` (check `Get-Process Inventor` first, or `-p:DeployToInventor=false`). Check interop members by reflection on `C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 2026\Bin\Autodesk.Inventor.Interop.dll`. Log: `%APPDATA%\AwbAddinwbaddin.log`. Use Python heredocs for file edits in Git Bash.

## Big items

| Item | Spec | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundations (M0) | 01 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Settings, log, ribbon, error reporting, Settings and About windows, editing-command base, "AWB Addin" branding |
| Part properties window (M1) | 07 | **Built and merged, partly tested in Inventor** | Opens on parts and assemblies, pre-fills, writes and undoes correctly. A never-saved part shows New part, Not saved yet and Not assigned; the blank Part type entry can be clicked. Some checklist steps not yet reported; see `TODO.md` |
| Window style and icons (M1b) | 08 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Tasks 020 to 031. Shared look in light and dark, all three windows restyled, icons on ribbon and headers, XAML rules test. Every check passed on Windows. Two follow-ups on the build's deploy line are in `TODO.md` |
| Part creation and numbering (M2) | 02 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Every check passed; the last run 1 checks were reported on 2026-10-17. Run 2 checked on Windows 2026-10-11; fix run 053 to 061 and fix run 2 (spike 062, tasks 063 to 066) checked 2026-10-12 and passed. Merged into main from `claude/m2-fix-run` |
| Material and finish (M3) | 03 | **Done, tested in Inventor** | Tasks 067 to 080, merged into main from `claude/m3-material-finish` on 2026-10-17: starter library and finish list, Material and Finish window and button, Part Properties Change button and warning, Settings and About on every ribbon, windows that fit the screen, Settings as one resizable page of collapsible sections, dialogs with only a close button, and a themed scroll bar. Every check passed |
| AWB Hole (M4 part 1) | 09 | **Built, waiting for Aidan's check in Inventor** | Decided by Aidan 2026-10-17; spike 081 done with Aidan. Tasks 082 to 090 checked by Aidan 2026-10-18 (making, picking, previewing, tapped and dowel holes, OK, Cancel and Undo work). Then built on branch `claude/m4-hole-generator`, compiled on Windows, not yet run in Inventor: fixes and requests 093 to 101, mockup 102 (approved with changes 2026-10-23), dowel seats 106, window redesign 104, takeover of Hole and H 091, Edit Feature and double-click 092. Aidan's first look on 2026-10-24 gave six changes, planned as tasks 103 (in place for every command, top priority), 105 and 107 to 119: client graphics preview, Simple and Taper Tapped types, Spotface, toleranced clearance holes, depths below the seat, centres per point, a window that fits at 150 percent. Aidan checked 091 to 106 on 2026-10-25: six failures and seven requests, planned as tasks 120 to 132 in the same round. The round is **Planned**, starting with spike 103 |
| Hole table wizard (M4 part 2) | 04 | Not started | Planned after AWB Hole. Core half needs three answers; add-in half needs a Windows spike |
| Drawing tools (M5) | 05 | Not started | Waiting on which commands Aidan wants. Will include a custom drawing template |
| iLogic injection (M6) | 06 | Not started | Waiting on which rules |
| Distribution (installer, download page) | none yet | Parked | Was to be decided when M2 was planned; still waiting on Aidan |

States used: Not started, Planned, In progress, Built (merged, not tested in Inventor), Partly tested, Done (tested in Inventor), Parked, Proposed.

## What works in Inventor today

- An **AWB Addin** tab on the part, assembly and drawing ribbons, and with no document open; Settings and About are on it everywhere.
- **Part Properties** (parts and assemblies): shows part number, part name, part type, designer, detailer, cost, material, finish and weight. Part type, designer, detailer and cost can be edited. One Undo reverts an Apply.
- **One shared window look** in Inventor's light and dark themes, with keyboard navigation, and icons on the ribbon buttons and window headers.
- **Settings**: show developer tools, default designer. One scrolling page of collapsible sections, resizable by its edges and remembered (tasks 079, 080).
- **About**: version, build time, Inventor version, log folder.
- **Developer panel** (off by default): export the active document or the asset libraries to JSON.
- **Build deploy line**: a Windows build copies the add-in into Inventor and says whether it did. The `Deployed` line shows only with `-tl:off`; see `TODO.md`.

## Numbers

- Tasks finished: 90 (001 to 090), plus 091 to 102, 104 and 106 on branch `claude/m4-hole-generator`
- Core tests: 2650 after task 080; they run in the cloud and on Windows with `dotnet test tests/InventorAddin.Core.Tests`
